User Stories


Login:
As a logged-out user, I want to log in with my Google account so my schedule is linked with the web app. When the “Sign in with Google” button is pressed the user will be redirected to their home page if the login was successful.
One possible issue is that the user doesn’t have an existing Google account which will be handled by offering the user a link to create a Google account. If the user inputs an incorrect username or password Google would handle the issue.

* What should happen:
   * User clicks “Sign in with Google” button
   * Redirect to home page on successful sign in
* Issues:
   * If user doesn’t have a Google account
      * Provide link to create one
   * User enters incorrect username/password
      * Google would handle sign in issues

	  
	  
Viewing Calendar:
As a logged-in user, I want to see days and times that I’m free with my Google Calendar so I can browse through potential events in the area during those times.
On the page the user’s monthly calendar will be shown. The user will click on a day and time that they’re free. After selecting a time they’re available a list of events will come up events that are happening during that time.
An issue that might come up is that the user might not be logged in which would be solved by referring the user to the login page. If there are no events available during their selected times a message will let the user know.

RSVP to event:
As a user who has chosen a free day, time, and event to go to, I want to RSVP to the event and add it to my Google Calendar. After selecting a time the user is available the user will be given a list of events.
When the user selects an events the app adds the event to their calendar and RSVP’s to the event.

* What should happen:
   * User’s monthly calendar is shown
   * User selects a free day/time
   * User selects one of the possible events available on that day and the app adds an RSVP on that day/time for that event
* Issues:
   * User RSVP's to event that conflicts with previous event
	 * All events will be shown on calendar, user will have to decide
