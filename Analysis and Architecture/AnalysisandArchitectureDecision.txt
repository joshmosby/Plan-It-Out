Happy Path:
1. Google Calendar API displays the user’s calendar for the current month.
2. The user selects a day and time on the calendar that they are free.
3. The Eventbrite API is requested and returns a list of events on that day and time.


Things that can go wrong:
1. The user turned off location access on their web browser
   1. Provide an input box to ask the user to enter their location
1. The Eventbrite API does not return any events
   1. Display a message letting them know nothing is available
1. The user selects a day and time that they are not free
   1. Ask the if they are sure they want to search events during that time
      1. If they click yes show events
      2. If they click no then exit



Angular JS is the framework we are going to use. 
Most of our team has had some experience with Python so we are welcoming the challenge 
of working with the limited resources for Angular 2.0. We do not want to use Angular 1.x 
because most of us have no real experience with JavaScript and we believe it would be more 
beneficial learning the latest version.
